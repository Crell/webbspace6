CSS MODULE
-----

The CSS module adds, for users with enough permissions and enabled nodes, a CSS field on the node creation page.

Users might insert CSS rules in the CSS node field and those rules will be parsed on the node viewing.
This way CSS experienced users might create complex CSS based designs for nodes contents.

IMPORTANT: note that the CSS editing permissions should be given only to trusted users (administrators). Malicious users which have this permission might broke your site design and also introduce security issues (XSS).
